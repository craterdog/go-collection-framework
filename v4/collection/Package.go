Package "collection" defines a set of simple, pragmatic abstract types and
interfaces for Go based collections of values. It also provide an efficient and
compact implementation of the following collection classes based on these
abstractions:
  - Array (extended Go array)
  - Map (extended Go map)
  - List (a sortable list)
  - Catalog (a sortable map)
  - Set (an ordered set)
  - Stack (a LIFO)
  - Queue (a blocking FIFO)

For detailed documentation on this package refer to the wiki:
  - https://github.com/craterdog/go-collection-framework/wiki

This package follows the Crater Dog Technologies™ (craterdog) Go Coding
Conventions located here:
  - https://github.com/craterdog/go-model-framework/wiki

Additional implementations of the classes provided by this package can be
developed and used seamlessly since the interface definitions only depend on
other interfaces and primitive types; and the class implementations only depend
on interfaces, not on each other.

output queues specified by the size parameter and returns a sequence of the new
output queues. Each value added to the input queue will be added automatically
to ALL of the output queues. This pattern is useful when a set of DIFFERENT
operations needs to occur for every value and each operation can be done in
parallel.

Split() connects the output of the specified input Queue with the number of
output queues specified by the size parameter and returns a sequence of the new
output queues. Each value added to the input queue will be added automatically
to ONE of the output queues. This pattern is useful when a SINGLE operation
needs to occur for each value and the operation can be done on the values in
parallel.  The results can then be consolidated later on using the Join()
function.

Join() connects the outputs of the specified sequence of input queues with a new
output queue returns the new output queue. Each value removed from each input
queue will automatically be added to the output queue.  This pattern is useful
when the results of the processing with a Split() function need to be
consolidated into a single queue.

This approach allows for positive indices starting at the beginning of the

indices are symmetrical.
