Package "agent" defines a set of agents that operate on values of a generic

This package follows the Crater Dog Technologiesâ„¢ (craterdog) Go Coding
Conventions located here:

Additional implementations of the classes provided by this package can be
developed and used seamlessly since the interface definitions only depend on
other interfaces and intrinsic types; and the class implementations only depend
on interfaces, not on each other.

/*
RankingFunction[V any] defines the signature for any function that can determine
the relative ordering of two values. The result must be one of the following:

	LesserRank: The first value is less than the second value.
	EqualRank: The first value is equal to the second value.
	GreaterRank: The first value is more than the second value.

The meaning of "lesser" and "greater" is determined by the specific function
that implements this signature.

IteratorLike[V any] defines the set of abstractions and methods that must be
supported by all iterator-like instances.  An iterator-like class can be used to
move forward and backward over the values in a sequence.  It implements the Gang
of Four (GoF) Iterator Design Pattern:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern

A iterator agent locks into the slots that reside between each value in the
sequence:

	    [value 1] . [value 2] . [value 3] ... [value N]
	  ^           ^           ^                         ^
	slot 0      slot 1      slot 2                    slot N

It moves from slot to slot and has access to the values (if they exist) on each
side of the slot.  At each slot an iterator has access to the previous value
and next value in the sequence (assuming they exist). The slot at the start of
the sequence has no PREVIOUS value, and the slot at the end of the sequence has
no NEXT value.

This type is parameterized as follows:
  - V is any type of value.

An iterator-like class is supported by all collection types.

	// Attributes

SorterLike[V any] defines the set of abstractions and methods that must be

function is specified the values are sorted into their natural order.
