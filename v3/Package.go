Package "collections" defines a set of simple, pragmatic abstract types and
interfaces for Go based collections of values. It also provide an efficient and
compact implementation of the following collection classes based on these
abstractions:
  - Array (extended Go array)
  - Map (extended Go map)
  - List (a sortable list)
  - Catalog (a sortable map)
  - Set (an ordered set)
  - Stack (a LIFO)
  - Queue (a blocking FIFO)

For detailed documentation on this package refer to the wiki:
  - https://github.com/craterdog/go-collection-framework/wiki

This package follows the Crater Dog Technologies™ (craterdog) Go Coding
Conventions located here:
  - https://github.com/craterdog/go-package-framework/wiki

Additional implementations of the classes provided by this package can be
developed and used seamlessly since the interface definitions only depend on
other interfaces and primitive types; and the class implementations only depend
on interfaces, not on each other.

/*
RankingFunction defines the signature for any function that can determine
the relative ordering of two values. The result must be one of the following:

	-1: The first value is less than the second value.
	 0: The first value is equal to the second value.
	 1: The first value is more than the second value.

The meaning of "less" and "more" is determined by the specific function that
implements this signature.

/*
Accessible[V Value] defines the set of method signatures that must be
supported by all sequences whose values can be accessed using indices. The
indices of an accessible sequence are ORDINAL rather than ZERO based—which
never really made sense except for pointer offsets. What is the "zeroth
value" anyway? It's the "first value", right?  So we start fresh...

This approach allows for positive indices starting at the beginning of the
sequence, and negative indices starting at the end of the sequence as follows:

	    1           2           3             N
	[value 1] . [value 2] . [value 3] ... [value N]
	   -N        -(N-1)      -(N-2)          -1

Notice that because the indices are ordinal based, the positive and negative
indices are symmetrical.

  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern

A iterator agent locks into the slots that reside between each value in the
sequence:

	    [value 1] . [value 2] . [value 3] ... [value N]
	  ^           ^           ^                         ^
	slot 0      slot 1      slot 2                    slot N

It moves from slot to slot and has access to the values (if they exist) on each
side of the slot.  At each slot an iterator has access to the previous value
and next value in the sequence (assuming they exist). The slot at the start of
the sequence has no PREVIOUS value, and the slot at the end of the sequence has
no NEXT value.

This type is parameterized as follows:
